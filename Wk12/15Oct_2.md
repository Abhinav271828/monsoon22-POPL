# Lambda Calculus (contd.)
## Encoding Data in Lambda Calculus
### Primitives
We can define an operator `:` to uncurry a function, as follows:
```scheme
(define :
  (lambda (f x . xs)
    (cond xs
      [(null? xs) (f x)]
      [else (apply : (f x) xs)])))
```
We can define currying operators `lambda:` and `define:` to curry functions:
```scheme
(define-syntax lambda:
  (syntax-rules ()
    [(lambda: (x) body) (lambda x body)]
    [(lambda: (x y ...) body)
        (lambda x (lambda: (y ...) body))]))

(define-syntax define:
  (syntax-rules ()
    [(define: (f x y ...) body)
        (define f (lambda: (x y ...) body))]))
```

### Booleans
With these, we can start encoding more conventional types of data in lambda calculus. We will start with booleans:
```scheme
(define: (true x y) x)
(define: (false x y) y)
```

We can now use this to define an if-then-else construct:
```scheme
(define: (ifte x y z) (: x y z))
```

The definitions of boolean operators are straightforward:
```scheme
(define: (not a) (: a false true))

(define: (and a b) (: a b false))

(define: (or a b) (: a true b))
```

### Numbers
The *Church encoding* of numerals in lambda calculus is as follows. We define zero as
```scheme
(define: (z f x) x)
```
and the successor function as
```scheme
(define: (s n f x) (f (: n f x)))
```

Intuitively, the encoding of a number `n` is a function that takes two arguments, `f` and `x`, and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times.

We can define a predicate for zero as
```scheme
(define: (z? n)
  (: n (lambda (x) false) true))
```

We can define addition using this encoding:
```scheme
(define: (add m n f x)
  (: m f (: n f x)))
```

Multiplication involves finding the $m^\text{th}$ iterate of the $n^\text{th}$ iterate of `f`:
```scheme
(define: (mul m n f)
  (: m (n f)))
```

### Pairs & Predecessors
We define a pair using a function that takes three arguments, therefore "storing" the first two until it is passed a selector function:
```scheme
(define: (pair a b sel) (: sel a b))
```
The application of the selector argument means that we can extract the items of the pair as
```scheme
(define: (fst p) (: p true))
(define: (snd p) (: p false))
```

We can use pairs to define predecessor, and inductively, subtraction. Consider the function `next`, which operates on a pair by pushing its first element to the second position and incrementing the first element:
```scheme
(define: (next p) (: pair (s (fst p)) (fst p)))
```
To define the predecessor function, we start with a pair of zeroes, and apply `next` on it `n` times, which leaves the predecessor of `n` in the second element of the pair.
```scheme
(define: (pred n) (snd (: n next (: pair z z))))
```
Note that the predecessor of zero is defined to be zero.

This can be used to define subtraction, by simple repeated application
```scheme
(define: (sub m n) (: n pred m))
```
To be precise, however, this is *saturated subtraction*; it actually computes $\max(m-n, 0)$.

This is a convenient stepping stone to relational operators:
```scheme
(define: (leq m n)
  (: z? (: sub m n)))
(define: (geq m n)
  (: leq n m))
```

### Recursion
Consider the example of factorial. Since lambda calculus has no named functions, we cannot proceed as in Scheme, referencing a function in its own definition. Rather, we can proceed by defining a helper function
```scheme
(define g
  (lambda f
    (lambda n
      (if (zero? n) 1
          (* n (f (sub1 n)))))))
```
