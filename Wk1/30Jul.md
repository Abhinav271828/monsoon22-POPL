# Introduction
There are two fundamentally different views of programs – as sets of instructions, or as expressions. The first view is modelled by Turing machines, while the second is represented by the lambda calculus.

The lambda calculus is a minimalistic system that considers programs as expressions to be reduced and evaluated. It consists of only three types of expressions: variables, abstractions, and applications, and a single rule for reduction, called $\beta$-reduction.

However, the lambda calculus is equivalent to Turing machines; they can each simulate the other.
